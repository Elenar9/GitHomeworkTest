Hello everyone my name is Danny Elena Romero.I was born in Colombia.
My favorite sport is Yoga because it allows me to relax and be calm in these troubled times.

My favorite food is the Mediterranean since its dishes are made with fresh products from each season and that is why it is versatile and very healthy.

I love this video because it talks about "the new normal"

An interesting fact about you:
Hello everyone ! I am an international analyst and this new career will help to complete my vision of the world, since the technological side is an area that should be explored since cyber security is a sensitive aspect and I am interested in exploring it.
Happy conding!
